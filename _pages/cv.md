Education
======
* Ph.D in Computer Scinenc, University of Waterloo, Waterloo Canada (Present)
* M.S. in Communications - Coding, Sharif University of Tech., Tehran, Iran , 2011
* B.S. in Electrical Engineering, Shahid Beheshti university, Tehran, Iran 2008

Research and Work experience
======
* Fall 2020: 
  * Research Intern, National Research Council (Canada)
  * Supervisor: Koray Karabina
  * Overview:  I am working on designing a secure mechanism to perform joins operation over encrypted data. Our work enables the data owner to outsource performing operations on his/her data while keeping the data private. 
  
* Summer 2020: 
  * Research Intern, Microsoft Research (US)
  * Supervisor: Robert Sim
  * Overview: Machine learned models trained on organizational com-munication data, such as emails in an enterprise, carryunique risks of breaching confidentiality. My project at MSR shows how confidentiality relates to privacy in an enterprise context, and designs a model to preserve confidentiality for correlated data while leveraging principles from differential privacy. 
  
* 2018-Present: 
  * Research and Teaching Assistant, University of Waterloo, Canada
  * Supervisor: Florian Kerschbaum
  * Overview: My research at UWaterloo includes evaluating/protecting security and privacy in data management and machine learning. I proposed an efficient scheme for reporting contextual outliers in big data, that protects the privacy of individuals in the database by using differential privacy techniques. I also evaluate the resilience of schemes that watermark neural networks. 
  
* 2015-2017: 
  * Research and Teaching Assistant, University of Calgary, Canada
  * Supervisor: Rei Safavi-Naini
  * Overview: I worked on post-quantum digital signatures. In particular, I introduced a scalable hash-based scheme for group signature that distributes the signature opening privilege among multiple authorities, removing the need for a central power. 

* 2012-2014: 
  * Manager of Cryptography Lab, Research Center of Informatic Industries (RCII), Tehran, Iran
  * Overview: I was responsible for designing tests for cryptographic algorithms and modules in collaboration with the Public Key Infrastructure group in RCII. I also was in charge of establishing and providing a road map for the Cryptography Lab for which purpose I lead research on Side Channel Analysis on smart cards.  

* 2009-2011:
  * Research and Teaching Assistant, Sharif University of Technology, Iran
  * Supervisor: MohammadReza Aref
  * Overview: During my Master's program, I introduced a new key distribution scheme in wireless sensor networks using combinatorial designs.
