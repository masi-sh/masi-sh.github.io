I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. I am a member of the Cryptography, Security and Privacy (CrySP) lab and am supervised by Dr. Florian Kerschbaum. My current research is security and privacy in data management and machine learning. I am in particular working on protecting the privacy of individuals in databases by using differential privacy techniques. 

I am currently (Fall 2020) working as a research intern at Naitonal Research Council (NRC) in Canada. My research project aims to securly design a mechanism to perform join operation over encrypted data. I conducted another internship over the past summer (Summer 2020), at Microsoft Research (United States), focusing on privacy techniques for correlated data, while training models on organizational communications (e.g. emails).

Prior to starting my PhD at University of Waterloo, I worked on a variety of topics in research institutes and industry. As research assistant at University of Calgary in Alberta, Canada, I proposed a post-quantum (hash-based) group signature scheme. As manager of cryptography lab in Research Center of Informatic Industries (RCII), in Tehran, Iran, I evaluated implementations of cryptographic algorithms, I also conducted studies to establish a side-channel analysis lab.  

I received my MSc and BSc degrees from Sharif University of Technology and Shahid Beheshti University respectively in Tehran, Iran. In my masters thesis, I proposed a combinatorial key predistribution scheme for wireless sensor networks with group deployment of nodes. In my undergraduate thesis, I evaluated the success of feature extraction by using princial compnent analysis in detecting the gender of face images. 

As my PhD program is reacihng its end, I am currently looking for more research internship positions to apply my knowledge and expertise to solve real world problems in security and privacy.
