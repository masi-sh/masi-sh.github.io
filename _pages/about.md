I just defended my PhD thesis at Computer Science department of the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. I am a member of the Cryptography, Security and Privacy (CrySP) lab and am supervised by Dr. Florian Kerschbaum. My research interests are: security and privacy in data management, security and privacy in machine learning,
differential privacy, mutli-party computation, and applied cryptography. 

In Fall 2020, I worked as a research intern at National Research Council (NRC) in Canada. My research project was designing a secure mechanism to perform join operation over encrypted data. I conducted another internship over Summer 2020, at Microsoft Research (United States), focusing on privacy techniques for correlated data, while training models on organizational communications (e.g. emails).

Prior to starting my PhD at University of Waterloo, I worked on a variety of topics in research institutes and industry. As research assistant at University of Calgary in Alberta, Canada, I proposed a post-quantum (hash-based) group signature scheme. As manager of cryptography lab in Research Center of Informatic Industries (RCII), in Tehran, Iran, I evaluated implementations of cryptographic algorithms, I also conducted studies to establish a side-channel analysis lab.  

I received my MSc and BSc degrees from Sharif University of Technology and Shahid Beheshti University respectively in Tehran, Iran. In my masters thesis, I proposed a combinatorial key predistribution scheme for wireless sensor networks with group deployment of nodes. In my undergraduate thesis, I evaluated the success of feature extraction by using principal component analysis in detecting the gender of face images. 

I am currently looking for research-oriented positions in security and privacy to apply my knowledge and expertise to solve real world problems.
